Perfect 👍 I see your **Business Card project** structure:

* `index.html` → contains the card layout with your avatar and details
* `styles.css` → handles the design, color palette, shadows, and hover effects
* `package.json` → shows it’s running with **Vite** as a dev environment

Here’s a polished **README.md** you can add directly to your GitHub repo:
